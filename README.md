# Chat with PDFs using ChatGPT and OpenAI GPT API

This is a supplementary python notebook for the blog - https://nanonets.com/blog/chat-with-pdfs-using-chatgpt-and-openai-gpt-api/. 
We dive into a detailed code tutorial on how to chat with all kinds of PDF files using OpenAI GPT API and use it for PDF automations / chatbots.

* We will chat with PDFs using just a few lines of Python code.
* We will chat with large PDF files using ChatGPT API and LangChain.
* We will build an automation to sort PDF files based on their contents.
* We will go through examples of building more automations for tasks involving PDFs.

All the code discussed in the blog can be accessed from the python notebook. We have also added the example PDF files used in the tutorial here.
